# **Credit Card Fraud Detection using Logistic Regression**  

## **ðŸ“„ Overview**  
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using **Logistic Regression**. The dataset contains transaction details, including anonymized features, and is highly imbalanced. The objective is to build a model that effectively classifies fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives.

## **ðŸ›  Key Features**  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:  
  - Analyzed transaction patterns and identified key differences between **legitimate vs. fraudulent** transactions.  
  - Visualized fraud distribution and correlations among key features.  

- **Data Preprocessing**:  
  - Handled **missing values** and scaled numerical features using **StandardScaler**.  
  - Addressed **class imbalance** using **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** to improve fraud detection.  

- **Machine Learning Model**:  
  - **Built and trained a Logistic Regression model** for fraud classification.  
  - Tuned hyperparameters to optimize performance.  

- **Evaluation Metrics**:  
  - Assessed model effectiveness using **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and AUC-ROC Curve**.  
  - Focused on **Recall** to prioritize fraud detection while minimizing false negatives.
